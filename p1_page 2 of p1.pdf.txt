percentage) for a ﬁxed energy (E = 0.42t). (b) Misﬁt func-
tion χ (in arbitrary units) as a function of n. The vertical
(red) dashed line on the lower part of the panel indicates the
real number of impurities used to generate the sample conduc-
tance, which coincides with the minimum of χ(n). The (black)

mate concentration n∗. Integration limits were E−= 0.5t and
E+ = 1.5t and the solid (blue) line is simply a guide to the

from simple conductance measurements. Note that no
prior knowledge of the actual number of impurities was
necessary to identify the misﬁt-function minimum.
To demonstrate that the agreement between the min-
imizing concentration of χ and the actual impurity con-
centration is not a fortuitous coincidence, we proceed to
write the CA conductance [10] to linear order in n
⟨Γ(E, n)⟩= Γ0(E) −β(E) n,

where β(E) is the derivative of ⟨Γ(E, n)⟩with respect
to n evaluated at n = 0. The misﬁt function χ(n) will
naturally develop a minimum at n∗= −B/A, where

The vertical (black) dotted line shown on the upper part
of Fig. 2(b) indicates the value of n∗. Note that both
the dotted and dashed lines are aligned, i.e., n∗coin-
cides not only with the actual concentration n but also
with the impurity concentration that minimizes χ(n). In
fact, n∗is an excellent approximation up to 3% impurity
concentration and provides a simple yet accurate way of
identifying the misﬁt function minimum. [22]
Besides the impurity concentration, other degrees of
freedom can be added to the IP in question. Let us now
consider an arbitrary sample conductance but this time

FIG. 3. 2D contour plots of the logarithm of the misﬁt func-

assume that nothing is known about the impurity, i.e.,
neither its concentration n nor its on-site potential ϵ. In
this case, the input Γ(E) is simply treated as the con-
ductance of a system with an unknown number of un-
speciﬁed impurities. To calculate the misﬁt function we
must compute the CA conductance which will now de-
pend on ϵ as well as n.
A 2D contour plot of χ as a
function of these two quantities is shown in Fig. 3(a).
A distinctive minimum is seen which, once again, coin-
cides with the exact values used to generate the input
conductance, shown as dashed lines. Consequently, both
the type and concentration of scattering centres inside
a quantum device can be identiﬁed through its energy-
dependent conductance ﬁngerprints. Furthermore, still
using two degrees of freedom, the IP can also be im-
plemented in the case of two types of impurities with
unknown concentrations. In other words, two impurities
described by known on-site potentials ϵA and ϵB are ran-
domly dispersed with respective concentrations nA and
nB, which are unknown. Writing the CA conductance
as a function of both concentrations leads to the mis-
ﬁt function being plotted now as a function of the same
quantities in Fig. 3(b). The dashed lines stand for the
actual values nA and nB.
They accurately match the
concentration values that minimize the misﬁt function.
This indicates that it is possible to increase the number
of degrees of freedom in the inversion procedure, oﬀering
variety and versatility in how we wish to interrogate the
