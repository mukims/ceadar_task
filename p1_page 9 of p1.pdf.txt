ily found from ΓDFT

, which corresponds to the con-
ductance in the presence of only a single impurity.
It
follows from a simple plot of the misﬁt function as a
function of the impurity on-site potential, i.e. χ(ϵ) =
R
dE[ΓDFT

−ΓTB
1 (ϵ)]2. In this case ΓTB
1 (ϵ) is the tight-
binding conductance of a ribbon with a single impurity
with on-site potential ϵ.
The function χ(ϵ) presents a
very distinctive minimum, which we adopt as the value
that best represents the scattering strength of the im-
purity. It is worth mentioning that it is not necessary
to know the exact location of the impurity in the DFT
calculation. In fact, this is automatically accounted for
by evaluating the misﬁt function χ(ϵ) for distinct impu-
rity locations in the tight-binding part of the calculation.
This is depicted in Fig.6. The absolute minimum found
for χ(ϵ) corresponds to the impurity location used in the
DFT-based conductance which also deﬁnes the value of
the on-site potential to be adopted in the subsequent CA
calculation.
Finally, it is also instructive to compare the conduc-
tance spectra ΓDFT
1
and ΓTB
1 , the latter being calculated
with the on-site potential ϵ obtained as described above.
Bearing in mind that the misﬁt function was obtained
by an integration in the 0 −0.2 eV energy range, the
agreement between the two results shown in Fig.7 is yet
another indication of the eﬀectiveness of our inversion
procedure since both curves were calculated separately
and independently.
2. DFT-based misﬁt function
Although the approach described above is undoubt-
edly a good strategy to illustrate what can be achieved
by carrying out the CA calculation within the TB model,
it is by no means essential. To make this point evident,
we have also carried out the CA part of the calculation
entirely within DFT without availing of any TB parame-
terization. For each concentration value, M=50 diﬀerent
DFT disordered conﬁgurations were considered, each one
of them generating conductance spectra with 500 energy
values. The obtained misﬁt function χ(n) seen in Fig. 8
displays the same distinctive trend seen previously and

The single impurity sample
conductance contains information about the location as well
as the scattering strength of the impurity. The variable y/W
indicates the impurity location, with y/W = 0 corresponding
to the edge of the GNR and y/W = 1/2 marking its centre.
