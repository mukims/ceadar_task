is the transmission autocorrelation length. Fortunately,
the conductance ﬂuctuations in mesoscopic systems are
characterized by δEcor that are typically much smaller
than the band width Z. Theory [1, 2] shows that δEcor
depends essentially on the mean level density and on the
average transmission ⟨Γ(E, n)⟩. We point out that the
same idea can be extended to variations other than the
energy, such as with external ﬁelds, strain, etc.
3. Device size and transport regime
It is important to assess how accurate the inversion
procedure is in diﬀerent transport regimes. Fig. 3 plots
the inversion accuracy as a function of the device size
L for a concentration of n = 4%. It is unquestionable
that the accuracy is very good (α < 0.1) for all sizes
considered. It is instructive to put this result in context
by looking at the localization length of the system, which
in the case of n = 4% of impurities is approximately
100 unit cells. That means that the inversion performs
remarkably well regardless of the transport regime, i.e.,
whether it is ballistic, diﬀusive or at the onset of the
localized regime.
4. Averaging procedure and statistical signiﬁcance of
the Conﬁguration Average (CA) calculations
As discussed in the main text, the underlying hypoth-
esis for the applicability of the method are that conduc-
tance ﬂuctuations contain very little system-speciﬁc in-
formation (depending on disorder they can even have a
universal character) and that the average conductance
depends smoothly on the variables of interest. To obtain

accurate averages from a data set of the conductance as
a function of a continuous (running) variable we use a
standard ergodic hypothesis [3]. To be more precise, let
us deﬁne the running average of a quantitity of interest
O as
⟨O(X)⟩≡
1
∆X
Z
dX O(X)
where X is a generic continuous (running) variable and
∆X is its corresponding range in the data set. In our
study we employ the ergodic hypothesis to replace av-
erages over conﬁgurational disorder (ensemble averages)
with running averages, i.e.,
Γ(X) = ⟨Γ(X)⟩
and
Γ(X)Γ(X + δX) = ⟨Γ(X)Γ(X + δX)⟩
Note that the conductance is a two-point Green’s func-
tion. This allows us to justify our statistical assumptions
based on the vast literature on both the Kubo conduc-
tity for disordered diﬀusive bulk systems and Landauer
conductance for disordered/chaotic nanostructures.
Regarding the number of conﬁgurations needed in the
CA procedure, as standard, the higher the value of
disorder realizations M the smaller the ﬂuctuations in
⟨Γ(E, n)⟩.
Universal conductance ﬂuctuations (UCF)
help one to obtain accurate results for ⟨Γ(E, n)⟩at a
modest value of M. Both for diﬀusive [4, 5] and chaotic
ballistic systems [6], var(Γ) ≈1 is the main ﬁngerprint of
UCF. Hence, the CA relative statistical error is expected
to scale with [
√
M × ⟨Γ(E, n)⟩]−1.
To bring the degree of ﬂuctuations to an acceptable
level and produce results that are statistically signiﬁcant,
we note that M is usually of the order 103. [7, 8]. One-
