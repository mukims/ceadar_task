universe of disorder conﬁgurations in the CA procedure.
The success of the inversion procedure will therefore de-
pend on how wide the integration range is. See SM [21]
for details on the suitable choices for integration limits.
Another feature of the conductance ﬂuctuations of
quantum devices [7, 33] is that the correlation function
C(δX) = ⟨Γ(X + δX/2)Γ(X −δX/2)⟩−⟨Γ(X)⟩2 is also
universal [31]. The latter is characterized by a correla-
tion length δXcor that is system dependent. Therefore,
the method works best when the integration interval ∆X
is such that ∆X/δXcor ≫1. In our case, where we con-
sider variations of the system chemical potential, δEcor
scales with the mean level density times the transmission
[34], which makes δEcor much larger than typical exper-
imental temperatures, justifying our earlier claim that
temperature has little eﬀect on our inversion procedure.
This also explains why the energy window used in the
misﬁt-function deﬁnition does not have to be very large.
In summary, the inversion procedure presented here
provides a mechanism capable of identifying the compo-
sition of scattering centres in a quantum device by sim-
ply looking at the energy dependence of the two-terminal
device conductance.
Assuming that the impurity type
within the device is known, the procedure establishes the
exact impurity concentration in it. Alternatively, if no in-
formation is known a priori about the scatterers, the in-
version identiﬁes their scattering strength and respective
concentration. Finally, with a mixture of two diﬀerent
types of impurities we are able to establish the fractional
concentration of each component of the device. Despite
being presented with GNR, the technique is not material-
speciﬁc and performs remarkably well in the ballistic, dif-
fusive and at the onset of localised transport regimes.
The method is based on the notion that conductance
ﬂuctuations carry little system-speciﬁc information, the
average conductance depends smoothly on the variables
of interest and on a standard ergodic hypothesis [30], re-
quiring only an eﬀective (single-particle) description of
the system. [35] This small set of conditions renders a
very robust and versatile methodology that can extract
structural and compositional information of quantum de-
vices from standard transport measurements.
