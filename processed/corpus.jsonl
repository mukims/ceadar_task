Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n3\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\n Multi-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\n√dk\n)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof 1√dk\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\n.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\n4\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ..., headh)W O\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\ni , KW K\ni , V W V\ni )\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesW Q\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W K\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W V\ni ∈ Rdmodel×dv\nand W O ∈ Rhdv×dmodel.\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[38, 2, 9].\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndf f = 2048.\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\n5\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\nOperations\nSelf-Attention O(n2 · d) O(1) O(1)\nRecurrent O(n · d2) O(n) O(n)\nConvolutional O(k · n · d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\nlearned and fixed [9].\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\nP Epos.\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n6\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10 −9. We varied the learning\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\nlrate = d−0.5\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\n7\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModel\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [18] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0 · 1020\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3 · 1019 1.4 · 1020\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6 · 1018 1.5 · 1020\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0 · 1019 1.2 · 1020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0 · 1020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8 · 1020 1.1 · 1021\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7 · 1019 1.2 · 1021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 · 1018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3 · 1019\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nPdrop = 0.1.\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0 .1 [36]. This\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n6 Results\n6.1 Machine Translation\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 .6 [38]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\n6.2 Model Variations\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n8\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base\nmodel. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\nresults to the base model.\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\n9\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\nof WSJ)\nParser Training WSJ 23 F1\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\nReferences\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Introduction\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\n3\n1.1. Contributions\nPost-T raining: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\nadvancements in this area.\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\nnon-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\nbetter models.\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful T oo\n• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\nmodels, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\nthrough RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\nthe research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\n• Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models\nthat are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that\nthe distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Addi-\ntionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500,\nand 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-\nsource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B,\n32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\n1.2. Summary of Evaluation Results\n• Reasoning tasks: (1) DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly\nsurpassing OpenAI-o1-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%,\nperforming on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2)\nOn coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks,\nas it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in\nthe competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than\nDeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks.\n• Knowledge: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-\nR1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores\nof 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its\nperformance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1\nsurpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational\ntasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed\nwhere OpenAI-o1 surpasses 4o on this benchmark.\n4\n• Others: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing,\ngeneral question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive\nlength-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on Are-\nnaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries.\nAdditionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring\nlong-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context\nbenchmarks.\n2. Approach\n2.1. Overview\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model\nperformance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly\nimproved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with\nthe inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1)\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and\n(2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to\nsmall dense models.\n2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data ,\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · ·, 𝑜𝐺} from the old\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃) = E[𝑞 ∼ 𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\n𝑖=1 ∼ 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\n1\n𝐺\n𝐺∑︁\n𝑖=1\n\u0012\nmin\n\u0012 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) 𝐴𝑖, clip\n\u0012 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞) , 1 − 𝜀, 1 + 𝜀\n\u0013\n𝐴𝑖\n\u0013\n− 𝛽D𝐾 𝐿\n\u0000\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\n\u0001\u0013\n, (1)\nD𝐾 𝐿\n\u0000\n𝜋𝜃|| 𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓\n\u0001 =\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − log\n𝜋𝑟𝑒 𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) − 1, (2)\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, . . . , 𝑟𝐺} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\n𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 − m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺})\ns𝑡𝑑 ({𝑟1, 𝑟2, · · ·, 𝑟𝐺}) .

User: prompt. Assistant:\nTable 1 | Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero. prompt will be replaced with the specific reasoning\nquestion during training.\n2.2.2. Reward Modeling\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL.\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two\ntypes of rewards:\n• Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct.\nFor example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required\nto provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable\nrule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\ntags.\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\n2.2.3. Training T emplate\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\nprocess.\n2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\nPerformance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-\nR1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated,\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the\nRL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant\nincrease, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels\ncomparable to OpenAI-o1-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL\nalgorithm in optimizing the model’s performance over time.\nTable 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI’s o1-0912\nmodels across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks. The findings reveal that RL empowers\n6\nModel AIME 2024 MATH-500 GPQA LiveCode CodeForcesDiamond Bench\npass@1 cons@64 pass@1 pass@1 pass@1 rating\nOpenAI-o1-mini 63.6 80.0 90.0 60.0 53.8 1820\nOpenAI-o1-0912 74.4 83.3 94.8 77.3 63.4 1843\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero 71.0 86.7 95.9 73.3 50.0 1444\nTable 2 | Comparison of DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI o1 models on reasoning-related\nbenchmarks.\nFigure 2 | AIME accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Zero during training. For each question, we sample\n16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised\nfine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model’s ability to\nlearn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-\nR1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example,\nwhen majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s performance\nescalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. The\nability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without\nmajority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further\nadvancements in reasoning tasks.\nSelf-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\nis a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities\nautonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model’s\nprogression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides\na clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle\ncomplex reasoning tasks.\nAs depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improve-\n7\nFigure 3 | The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL\nprocess. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time.\nment throughout the training process. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments\nbut rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the\nability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time compu-\ntation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens,\nallowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated\nbehaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection—where the model\nrevisits and reevaluates its previous steps—and the exploration of alternative approaches to\nproblem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead\nemerge as a result of the model’s interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This\nspontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s reasoning capabilities,\nenabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.\nAha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during\nthe training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as\nillustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase,\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial\napproach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities\nbut also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and\nsophisticated outcomes.\nThis moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers\nobserving its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather\nthan explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the\nright incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The\n“aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of\nintelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in\nthe future.\n8\nQuestion: If 𝑎 > 1, then the sum of the real solutions of\n√︁\n𝑎 − √\n𝑎 + 𝑥 = 𝑥 is equal to\nResponse: <think>\nTo solve the equation\n√︁\n𝑎 − √\n𝑎 + 𝑥 = 𝑥, let’s start by squaring both· · ·\u0010√︁\n𝑎 − √\n𝑎 + 𝑥\n\u00112\n= 𝑥2 =⇒ 𝑎 − √\n𝑎 + 𝑥 = 𝑥2.\nRearrange to isolate the inner square root term:\n(𝑎 − 𝑥2)2 = 𝑎 + 𝑥 =⇒ 𝑎2 − 2𝑎𝑥2 + ( 𝑥2)2 = 𝑎 + 𝑥 =⇒ 𝑥4 − 2𝑎𝑥2 − 𝑥 + ( 𝑎2 − 𝑎) = 0\n. . .\nWait, wait.

The\nmodel learns to rethink using an anthropomorphic tone. This is also an aha moment for us,\nallowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning.\nDrawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning\ncapabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces\nseveral issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,\nand language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\ncold-start data.\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\n2.3.1. Cold Start\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\nannotators.\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\nthe starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data\n9\ninclude:\n• Readability: A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable\nfor reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to\nhighlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,\nwe design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and\nfilters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\nresults.\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\na better way for reasoning models.\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\non reasoning tasks.\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\nReasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks. For\neach prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect\nabout 600k reasoning related training samples.\n10\nNon-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition,\nand translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of\nDeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential\nchain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries,\nsuch as “hello” we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of\napproximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.\nWe fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about\n800k samples.\n2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement\nlearning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-\nously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the\nmethodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the\nlearning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to\nreward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build\nupon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-\ning prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the\nassessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing\ninterference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire\nresponse of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and\nmitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation\nprocess. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us\nto train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\n2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly\nfine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using\nthe 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that\nthis straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller\nmodels. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-\n14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its\nreasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though\nincorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL\nstage to the broader research community.\n3. Experiment\nBenchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema\net al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al.,\n2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al.,\n2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,\n11\n2024d), Aider 1, LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) (2024-08 – 2025-01), Codeforces 2, Chinese\nNational High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024)3, and American Invitational Math-\nematics Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024). In addition to standard benchmarks, we\nalso evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we\nadhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li\net al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we\nonly feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we\nreport representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and\nLiveCodeBench.\nEvaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as\nMMLU, DROP , GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-\nevals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a\nzero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts\nare few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot\nmay hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation\nprotocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the\nHumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,\nC#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated\nusing CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces\ndataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,\nafter which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench\nverified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related\nbenchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum\nof 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.\nBaselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including\nDeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217.\nSince accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its perfor-\nmance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).\nEvaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.\nWe found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in\nhigher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we\ndefault to pass@𝑘 evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.\nSpecifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘\nresponses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1\nis then calculated as\npass@1 = 1\n𝑘\n𝑘∑︁\n𝑖=1\n𝑝𝑖,\nwhere 𝑝𝑖 denotes the correctness of the 𝑖-th response. This method provides more reliable\nperformance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang\net al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.\n1https://aider.chat\n2https://codeforces.com\n3https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html\n12\n3.1.

This im-\nprovement is primarily attributed to enhanced accuracy in STEM-related questions, where signif-\nicant gains are achieved through large-scale reinforcement learning. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1\nexcels on FRAMES, a long-context-dependent QA task, showcasing its strong document analysis\ncapabilities. This highlights the potential of reasoning models in AI-driven search and data\nanalysis tasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed where\nOpenAI-o1 surpasses GPT-4o on this benchmark. However, DeepSeek-R1 performs worse than\nDeepSeek-V3 on the Chinese SimpleQA benchmark, primarily due to its tendency to refuse\nanswering certain queries after safety RL. Without safety RL, DeepSeek-R1 could achieve an\naccuracy of over 70%.\nDeepSeek-R1 also delivers impressive results on IF-Eval, a benchmark designed to assess a\nmodel’s ability to follow format instructions. These improvements can be linked to the inclusion\nof instruction-following data during the final stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL\ntraining. Furthermore, remarkable performance is observed on AlpacaEval2.0 and ArenaHard,\nindicating DeepSeek-R1’s strengths in writing tasks and open-domain question answering. Its\nsignificant outperformance of DeepSeek-V3 underscores the generalization benefits of large-scale\nRL, which not only boosts reasoning capabilities but also improves performance across diverse\ndomains. Moreover, the summary lengths generated by DeepSeek-R1 are concise, with an\naverage of 689 tokens on ArenaHard and 2,218 characters on AlpacaEval 2.0. This indicates that\n13\nDeepSeek-R1 avoids introducing length bias during GPT-based evaluations, further solidifying\nits robustness across multiple tasks.\nOn math tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217,\nsurpassing other models by a large margin. A similar trend is observed on coding algorithm\ntasks, such as LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, where reasoning-focused models dominate these\nbenchmarks. On engineering-oriented coding tasks, OpenAI-o1-1217 outperforms DeepSeek-R1\non Aider but achieves comparable performance on SWE Verified. We believe the engineering\nperformance of DeepSeek-R1 will improve in the next version, as the amount of related RL\ntraining data currently remains very limited.\n3.2.

However, there is still one question left: can the model achieve comparable performance\nthrough the large-scale RL training discussed in the paper without distillation?\nTo answer this question, we conduct large-scale RL training on Qwen-32B-Base using math,\ncode, and STEM data, training for over 10K steps, resulting in DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.

However, DeepSeek-R1-\nDistill-Qwen-32B, which is distilled from DeepSeek-R1, performs significantly better than\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across all benchmarks.\nTherefore, we can draw two conclusions: First, distilling more powerful models into smaller\nones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL mentioned in\nthis paper require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance\nof distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing\nbeyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-\nscale reinforcement learning.\n4.2. Unsuccessful Attempts\nIn the early stages of developing DeepSeek-R1, we also encountered failures and setbacks along\nthe way. We share our failure experiences here to provide insights, but this does not imply that\nthese approaches are incapable of developing effective reasoning models.\nProcess Reward Model (PRM) PRM is a reasonable method to guide the model toward better\napproaches for solving reasoning tasks (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al.,\n2023). However, in practice, PRM has three main limitations that may hinder its ultimate suc-\ncess. First, it is challenging to explicitly define a fine-grain step in general reasoning. Second,\ndetermining whether the current intermediate step is correct is a challenging task. Automated\nannotation using models may not yield satisfactory results, while manual annotation is not con-\nducive to scaling up. Third, once a model-based PRM is introduced, it inevitably leads to reward\nhacking (Gao et al., 2022), and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources\nand it complicates the whole training pipeline. In conclusion, while PRM demonstrates a good\nability to rerank the top-N responses generated by the model or assist in guided search (Snell\net al., 2024), its advantages are limited compared to the additional computational overhead it\nintroduces during the large-scale reinforcement learning process in our experiments.\nMonte Carlo T ree Search (MCTS) Inspired by AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2017b) and AlphaZero (Sil-\nver et al., 2017a), we explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance test-time\ncompute scalability. This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\nunlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\n15\nexponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo’s core success relied on training a value model to\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\nsignificant challenge.\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning. Ultimately, DeepSeek-R1 achieves\nperformance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on a range of tasks.\nWe further explore distillation the reasoning capability to small dense models. We use\nDeepSeek-R1 as the teacher model to generate 800K training samples, and fine-tune several small\ndense models. The results are promising: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B outperforms GPT-4o\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet on math benchmarks with 28.9% on AIME and 83.9% on MATH. Other\ndense models also achieve impressive results, significantly outperforming other instruction-\ntuned models based on the same underlying checkpoints.\nIn the future, we plan to invest in research across the following directions for DeepSeek-R1.\n• General Capability: Currently, the capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 fall short of DeepSeek-V3\nin tasks such as function calling, multi-turn, complex role-playing, and JSON output.\nMoving forward, we plan to explore how long CoT can be leveraged to enhance tasks in\nthese fields.\n• Language Mixing: DeepSeek-R1 is currently optimized for Chinese and English, which\nmay result in language mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For\ninstance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is\nin a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future\nupdates.\n• Prompting Engineering: When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive\nto prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we\nrecommend users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a\nzero-shot setting for optimal results.\n• Software Engineering T asks: Due to the long evaluation times, which impact the effi-\nciency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software\nengineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement\nover DeepSeek-V3 on software engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address\nthis by implementing rejection sampling on software engineering data or incorporating\nasynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.\n16\nReferences\nAI@Meta.

We provide links to the original document where relevant so that you can always reference the Act text.\nTo explore the full text of the AI Act yourself, use our AI Act Explorer. Alternatively, if you want to know which parts of the text are most relevant to you, use our Compliance Checker. \nFour-point summary\nThe AI Act classifies AI according to its risk:\nUnacceptable risk is prohibited (e.g. social scoring systems and manipulative AI).\nMost of the text addresses high-risk AI systems, which are regulated.\nA smaller section handles limited risk AI systems, subject to lighter transparency obligations: developers and deployers must ensure that end-users are aware that they are interacting with AI (chatbots and deepfakes).\nMinimal risk is unregulated (including the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market, such as AI enabled video games and spam filters – at least in 2021; this is changing with generative AI).\nThe majority of obligations fall on providers (developers) of high-risk AI systems.\nThose that intend to place on the market or put into service high-risk AI systems in the EU, regardless of whether they are based in the EU or a third country.\nAnd also third country providers where the high risk AI system’s output is used in the EU.\nUsers are natural or legal persons that deploy an AI system in a professional capacity, not affected end-users.\nUsers (deployers) of high-risk AI systems have some obligations, though less than providers (developers).\nThis applies to users located in the EU, and third country users where the AI system’s output is used in the EU.\nGeneral purpose AI (GPAI):\nAll GPAI model providers must provide technical documentation, instructions for use, comply with the Copyright Directive, and publish a summary about the content used for training.\nFree and open licence GPAI model providers only need to comply with copyright and publish the training data summary, unless they present a systemic risk.\nAll providers of GPAI models that present a systemic risk – open or closed – must also conduct model evaluations, adversarial testing, track and report serious incidents and ensure cybersecurity protections.\nProhibited AI systems (Chapter II, Art. 5)\nThe following types of AI system are ‘Prohibited’ according to the AI Act.\nAI systems:\ndeploying subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to distort behaviour and impair informed decision-making, causing significant harm.\nexploiting vulnerabilities related to age, disability, or socio-economic circumstances to distort behaviour, causing significant harm.\nbiometric categorisation systems inferring sensitive attributes (race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation), except labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets or when law enforcement categorises biometric data.\nsocial scoring, i.e., evaluating or classifying individuals or groups based on social behaviour or personal traits, causing detrimental or unfavourable treatment of those people.\nassessing the risk of an individual committing criminal offenses solely based on profiling or personality traits, except when used to augment human assessments based on objective, verifiable facts directly linked to criminal activity.\ncompiling facial recognition databases by untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage.\ninferring emotions in workplaces or educational institutions, except for medical or safety reasons.\n‘real-time’ remote biometric identification (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement, except when:\nsearching for missing persons, abduction victims, and people who have been human trafficked or sexually exploited;\npreventing substantial and imminent threat to life, or foreseeable terrorist attack; or\nidentifying suspects in serious crimes (e.g., murder, rape, armed robbery, narcotic and illegal weapons trafficking, organised crime, and environmental crime, etc.).\nNotes on remote biometric identification:\nUsing AI-enabled real-time RBI is only allowed when not using the tool would cause considerable harm and must account for affected persons’ rights and freedoms.\nBefore deployment, police must complete a fundamental rights impact assessment and register the system in the EU database, though, in duly justified cases of urgency, deployment can commence without registration, provided that it is registered later without undue delay.\nBefore deployment, they also must obtain authorisation from a judicial authority or independent administrative authority[1], though, in duly justified cases of urgency, deployment can commence without authorisation, provided that authorisation is requested within 24 hours. If authorisation is rejected, deployment must cease immediately, deleting all data, results, and outputs.\n↲ [1] Independent administrative authorities may be subject to greater political influence than judicial authorities (Hacker, 2024).\nHigh risk AI systems (Chapter III)\nSome AI systems are considered ‘High risk’ under the AI Act. Providers of those systems will be subject to additional requirements.\nClassification rules for high-risk AI systems (Art. 6)\nHigh risk AI systems are those:\nused as a safety component or a product covered by EU laws in Annex I AND required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment under those Annex I laws; OR\nthose under Annex III use cases (below), except if:\nthe AI system performs a narrow procedural task;\nimproves the result of a previously completed human activity;\ndetects decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment without proper human review; or\nperforms a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use cases listed in Annex III.\nAI systems are always considered high-risk if it profiles individuals, i.e. automated processing of personal\ndata to assess various aspects of a person’s life, such as work performance, economic situation, health,\npreferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movement.\nProviders whose AI system falls under the use cases in Annex III but believes it is not high-risk must document such an\nassessment before placing it on the market or putting it into service.\nRequirements for providers of high-risk AI systems (Art. 8–17)\nHigh risk AI providers must:\nEstablish a risk management system throughout the high risk AI system’s lifecycle;\nConduct data governance, ensuring that training, validation and testing datasets are relevant, sufficiently representative and, to the best extent possible, free of errors and complete according to the intended purpose.\nDraw up technical documentation to demonstrate compliance and provide authorities with the information to assess that compliance.\nDesign their high risk AI system for record-keeping to enable it to automatically record events relevant for identifying national level risks and substantial modifications throughout the system’s lifecycle.\nProvide instructions for use to downstream deployers to enable the latter’s compliance.\nDesign their high risk AI system to allow deployers to implement human oversight.\nDesign their high risk AI system to achieve appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.\nEstablish a quality management system to ensure compliance.\nGeneral purpose AI (GPAI)\nGPAI model means an AI model, including when trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale, that displays significant generality and is capable to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications. This does not cover AI models that are used before release on the market for research, development and prototyping activities.\nGPAI system means an AI system which is based on a general purpose AI model, that has the capability to serve a variety of purposes, both for direct use as well as for integration in other AI systems.\nGPAI systems may be used as high risk AI systems or integrated into them. GPAI system providers should cooperate with such high risk AI system providers to enable the latter’s compliance.\nAll providers of GPAI models must:\nDraw up technical documentation, including training and testing process and evaluation results.\nDraw up information and documentation to supply to downstream providers that intend to integrate the GPAI model into their own AI system in order that the latter understands capabilities and limitations and is enabled to comply.\nEstablish a policy to respect the Copyright Directive.\nPublish a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training the GPAI model.\nFree and open licence GPAI models – whose parameters, including weights, model architecture and model usage are publicly available, allowing for access, usage, modification and distribution of the model – only have to comply with the latter two obligations above, unless the free and open licence GPAI model is systemic.\nGPAI models present systemic risks when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training is greater than 1025 floating point operations (FLOPs). Providers must notify the Commission if their model meets this criterion within 2 weeks. The provider may present arguments that, despite meeting the criteria, their model does not present systemic risks. The Commission may decide on its own, or via a qualified alert from the scientific panel of independent experts, that a model has high impact capabilities, rendering it systemic.\nIn addition to the four obligations above, providers of GPAI models with systemic risk must also:\nPerform model evaluations, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing to identify and mitigate systemic risk.\nAssess and mitigate possible systemic risks, including their sources.\nTrack, document and report serious incidents and possible corrective measures to the AI Office and relevant national competent authorities without undue delay.\nEnsure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection.\nAll GPAI model providers may demonstrate compliance with their obligations if they voluntarily adhere to a code of practice until European harmonised standards are published, compliance with which will lead to a presumption of conformity. Providers that don’t adhere to codes of practice must demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for Commission approval.\nCodes of practice\nWill account for international approaches.\nWill cover but not necessarily limited to the above obligations, particularly the relevant information to include in technical documentation for authorities and downstream providers, identification of the type and nature of systemic risks and their sources, and the modalities of risk management accounting for specific challenges in addressing risks due to the way they may emerge and materialise throughout the value chain.\nAI Office may invite GPAI model providers, relevant national competent authorities to participate in drawing up the codes, while civil society, industry, academia, downstream providers and independent experts may support the process.\nGovernance\nHow will the AI Act be implemented?\nThe AI Office will be established, sitting within the Commission, to monitor the effective implementation and compliance of GPAI model providers.\nDownstream providers can lodge a complaint regarding the upstream providers infringement to the AI Office.\nThe AI Office may conduct evaluations of the GPAI model to:\nassess compliance where the information gathered under its powers to request information is insufficient.\nInvestigate systemic risks, particularly following a qualified report from the scientific panel of independent experts.\nTimelines\nAfter entry into force, the AI Act will apply by the following deadlines:\n6 months for prohibited AI systems.\n12 months for GPAI. \n24 months for high risk AI systems under Annex III. \n36 months for high risk AI systems under Annex I.\nAnnex III use cases\nNon-banned biometrics: Remote biometric identification systems, excluding biometric verification that confirm a person is who they claim to be. Biometric categorisation systems inferring sensitive or protected attributes or characteristics. Emotion recognition systems.\nCritical infrastructure: Safety components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity.\nEducation and vocational training: AI systems determining access, admission or assignment to educational and vocational training institutions at all levels. Evaluating learning outcomes, including those used to steer the student’s learning process. Assessing the appropriate level of education for an individual. Monitoring and detecting prohibited student behaviour during tests.\nEmployment, workers management and access to self-employment: AI systems used for recruitment or selection, particularly targeted job ads, analysing and filtering applications, and evaluating candidates. Promotion and termination of contracts, allocating tasks based on personality traits or characteristics and behaviour, and monitoring and evaluating performance.\nAccess to and enjoyment of essential public and private services: AI systems used by public authorities for assessing eligibility to benefits and services, including their allocation, reduction, revocation, or recovery. Evaluating creditworthiness, except when detecting financial fraud. Evaluating and classifying emergency calls, including dispatch prioritising of police, firefighters, medical aid and urgent patient triage services. Risk assessments and pricing in health and life insurance.\nLaw enforcement:  AI systems used to assess an individual’s risk of becoming a crime victim. Polygraphs. Evaluating evidence reliability during criminal investigations or prosecutions. Assessing an individual’s risk of offending or re-offending not solely based on profiling or assessing personality traits or past criminal behaviour. Profiling during criminal detections, investigations or prosecutions.\nMigration, asylum and border control management:  Polygraphs. Assessments of irregular migration or health risks. Examination of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits, and associated complaints related to eligibility. Detecting, recognising or identifying individuals, except verifying travel documents.\nAdministration of justice and democratic processes:  AI systems used in researching and interpreting facts and applying the law to concrete facts or used in alternative dispute resolution. Influencing elections and referenda outcomes or voting behaviour, excluding outputs that do not directly interact with people, like tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tINFLATION CALCULATOR TEMPLATE\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tBase
