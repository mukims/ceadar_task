However, to do this in reverse, _i.e._, to find information about the composition\\nof scatterers in a device from its conductance, is an elusive task. This is particularly more challenging in the presence of disorder. Here we propose a procedure in which valuable compositional\\ninformation can be extracted from the seemingly noisy spectral conductance of a two-terminal disordered quantum device. In particular, we put forward an inversion methodology that can identify\\nthe nature and respective concentration of randomly-distributed impurities by analyzing energydependent conductance fingerprints. Results are shown for graphene nanoribbons as a case in point\\nusing both tight-binding and density functional theory simulations, indicating that this inversion\\ntechnique is general, robust and can be employed to extract structural and compositional information of disordered mesoscopic devices from standard conductance measurements.\\n\\n\\n\\nStructures whose dimensions are comparable to or\\nsmaller than the electronic mean free path display transport features not associated with the classical ohmic behaviour [1]. These are quantum features found by solving\\nthe Schrödinger equation once the system Hamiltonian\\nis known. Indeed, it is straightforward to describe how\\ncurrent flows in a quantum device by calculating its conductance once all scattering centres are specified. However, to do this in reverse, _i.e._, to find information about\\nscatterers in a quantum device by simply looking at its\\nconductance is rather challenging. This is a kind of Inverse Problem (IP) which consists of obtaining from a set\\nof observations the causal factors that generated them in\\nthe first place. IP are intrinsic parts of numerous visualization tools [2–5] but are not as common in the quantum\\nrealm, and even less so in the presence of disorder.\\nDisorder makes the description of the impurity potential by inverse scattering methods quite a daunting\\ntask. Multiple scattering depends on the scatterers’ locations and therefore likely to affect the electronic dynamics in seemingly unpredictable ways. To make matters\\nworse theory shows that quantum interference in chaotic\\n\\n[6] and/or diffusive systems [7] gives rise to fluctuations\\nwhose statistical properties are universal, _i.e._ system independent, indicating that standard IP methods are neither practical nor useful in such situations.\\nHere we give a different twist to quantum IP approaches and demonstrate that, instead of detrimental,\\ndisorder may be actually beneficial to extracting information about scattering centres in a quantum device.\\nIn particular, we focus on the energy-dependent conductance of a quantum system, hereafter referred to as the\\nconductance spectrum, which will serve as the only input of the inversion procedure described here. This is\\na quantity normally obtained by standard experimental\\nsetups of a gated two-terminal device but may also be\\n\\n\\n\\nfound by calculation once the underlying Hamiltonian is\\nfully specified. Here we introduce our inversion methodology by using the latter as a proxy for the former, _i.e_,\\ncalculated conductance spectra representing their experimental equivalent. The advantage of using calculated\\ninput functions is that we can refer back to the Hamiltonian that generated them in the first place, making it\\npossible to assess the success of the inversion procedure.\\nLet us start by defining the system to be used throughout the manuscript. It consists of two electrodes separated by a scattering region of length _L_ and width\\n_W_, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), a rather typical setup\\nof electronic transport. The distinction between the\\nleads and the central region is that the latter contains\\nimpurities as scattering centres [8]. In the linear response� regime, the Landauer conductance reads =\\n_G_\\n2 _e_ [2] _/h_ _dE_ ( _−∂f/∂E_ )Γ( _E_ ), where _f_ ( _E_ ) is the Fermi distribution and Γ( _E_ ) is the dimensionless conductance (or\\ntransmission) given by [9, 10]\\n\\n          -          Γ( _E_ ) = tr **G** _[r]_ ( _E_ ) **Γ** _R_ ( _E_ ) **G** _[a]_ ( _E_ ) **Γ** _L_ ( _E_ ) (1)\\n\\n\\nHere **G** _[r]_ ( **G** _[a]_ = [ **G** _[r]_ ] _[†]_ ) is the full retarded (advanced)\\nGreen function and **Γ** _L_ ( **Γ** _R_ ) is the line width function\\naccounting for the injection and lifetime of states in the\\nleft (right) contact. For simplicity, we consider the zerotemperature limit _G_ = 2 _e_ [2] _/h_ Γ( _E_ ). Thermal corrections\\nwill be shown to have little effect on our procedure.\\nThe expression for Γ in Eq. (1) is model-independent,\\n_i.e._, once the Hamiltonian is known one can find the corresponding Green function and obtain the energy dependent conductance of the system [9]. We focus on systems with relatively simple electronic structures, namely\\ngraphene nanoribbons (GNR). Although not an essential requirement, it helps to illustrate the methodology\\nsince GNR are well described by the tight-binding model\\n\\n[11, 12].

(a) Schematic diagram of the system under consideration. Two semi-infinite leads of width _W_ are separated by\\na region of length _L_ containing a concentration _n_ of impurities represented by red dots. (b) Calculated conductance for\\na system made of a graphene nanoribbon of length _L_ = 100\\nunit cells as a function of the chemical potential (in units\\nof _t_ ). The dashed line corresponds to the conductance of\\nthe pristine system, _i.e._, in the absence of impurities. The\\nsolid line shows the conductance for a disordered configuration containing _N_ = 42 substitutional impurities ( _ϵ_ = 0 _._ 5 _t_ ),\\nwhich accounts for a concentration of _n_ = 3%.\\n\\n\\nand the on-site energies fully define the electronic structure of the nanoribbon. Fig. 1(b) shows the energydependent conductance for an armchair-edged GNR of\\nwidth _W_ = 3 _a_, _a_ = 2 _._ 7Å being the graphene lattice parameter. The dashed line is the conductance spectrum\\nΓ0 for the pristine GNR. Results are shown for positive\\nenergies knowing that Γ0( _E_ ) = Γ0( _E_ ).\\n\\n_−_\\nWe now introduce _N_ substitutional impurities. It\\nis convenient to express the impurity number also as\\nthe percentage concentration _n_ defined as _n_ = 100 _×_\\n( _N/N_ tot), where _N_ tot is the total number of sites in the\\ncentral region. Both _N_ and _n_ will be used interchangeably. The scattering strength of the impurities is characterized by the contrast between their on-site potential\\n_ϵ_ relative to that of the host, chosen to be zero. The\\nsolid line of Fig. 1(b) shows the conductance for the GNR\\nwith _N_ = 42 impurities, _ϵ_ = 0 _._ 5 _t_ and _L_ = 100 unit cells\\n( _n_ = 3%). Impurity locations were randomly selected but\\nkept fixed in the underlying Hamiltonian that generated\\nthe conductance Γ( _E_ ) of Fig. 1(b).\\nBeing the conductance sensitive to the locations of\\nscattering centres, it is difficult to devise an inversion tool\\ncapable of spatially mapping all impurities from the conductance spectrum information alone. The brute-force\\nmethod of comparing the input conductance Γ( _E_ ) with\\nthose of every possible disorder configuration is not viable\\nbecause the number of combinations is too large for any\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\npractical situation. Machine-learning strategies are currently being attempted to overcome this combinatorial\\nhurdle [13–20] but spatial mapping of quantum devices\\nthrough inversion remains challenging.\\nNevertheless, given the conductance spectrum Γ( _E_ ) of\\na device, one might ask whether it is possible to find the\\nexact number of scattering centres in it. This may not\\nreveal the position of every impurity but it is a valuable\\npiece of information and a lot more feasible to obtain.\\nWhile the brute-force approach remains impractical, we\\nmust account for as many disorder realizations as possible. We define the configurationally averaged (CA) conductance _⟨_ Γ _⟩_ by summing over _M_ realizations with the\\nsame number _N_ of impurities (or concentration _n_ ), _i.e._,\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere _j_ labels the different configurations. See SM [21]\\nfor a discussion on the suitable choices for _M_ .\\nThe deviation between an arbitrary conductance result\\nand its CA counterpart is given by\\n\\n\\n∆Γ( _E, n_ ) = Γ( _E_ ) _−⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ (3)\\n\\nWe reiterate that Γ( _E_ ) acts as the input conductance\\nspectrum of a single realization and represents the immutable conductance of the device under investigation.\\nThe CA conductance spectrum, on the other hand, reflects the contribution of very many configurations and\\ndepends, in addition, on the impurity concentration. By\\ntreating _n_ as a variable parameter, we can look for minimization trends in ∆Γ( _E, n_ ) that might indicate the real\\nconcentration in the device. Unfortunately, when plotted as a function of _n_ in Fig. 2(a), the deviation ∆Γ for\\na fixed energy _E_ is featureless with wide error bars that\\nresult from repeating the calculation 1000 times.\\nHowever, much cleaner trends are seen when ∆Γ is\\nused in the form of a functional that measures how good\\na match Γ( _E_ ) and _⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ are. This quantity is the\\nmisfit function _χ_ ( _n_ ) defined as\\n\\n       - _E_ +\\n_χ_ ( _n_ ) = _dE_ [ Γ( _E_ ) _−⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ ] [2] _,_ (4)\\n\\n_E−_\\n\\nwhere _E−_ and _E_ + establish the energy window over which\\nthe integration takes place. Fig. 2(b) shows _χ_ as a function of _n_ and displays a more distinctive trend with\\nsmaller error bars. The plot indicates that there is a\\nsweet spot in impurity concentration for which the integrated deviation is minimal. Remarkably, this agrees\\nwith the actual number of impurities used in the calculation of Γ( _E_ ), shown as a vertical (red) dashed line in\\nthe lower part of Fig. 2(b). Such a coincidence suggests\\nthat it might be possible to use _χ_ ( _n_ ) as an inversion tool\\nto find the number of impurities in a quantum device\\n\\n\\n\\nΓ( _E, n_ ) = [1]\\n_⟨_ _⟩_ _M_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- _M_\\n\\nΓ _j_ ( _E_ ) _,_ (2)\\n_j_ =1\\n\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n\\n1.2\\n\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\\n\\nϵ\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n0 2 4 6 8\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\n\\n\\n(%)\\n\\n\\n\\nFIG. 2.

(b): _χ_ as a function of _na_ and _nb_ .\\n\\n\\nassume that nothing is known about the impurity, _i.e._,\\nneither its concentration _n_ nor its on-site potential _ϵ_ . In\\nthis case, the input Γ( _E_ ) is simply treated as the conductance of a system with an unknown number of unspecified impurities. To calculate the misfit function we\\nmust compute the CA conductance which will now depend on _ϵ_ as well as _n_ . A 2D contour plot of _χ_ as a\\nfunction of these two quantities is shown in Fig. 3(a).\\nA distinctive minimum is seen which, once again, coincides with the exact values used to generate the input\\nconductance, shown as dashed lines. Consequently, both\\nthe type and concentration of scattering centres inside\\na quantum device can be identified through its energydependent conductance fingerprints. Furthermore, still\\nusing two degrees of freedom, the IP can also be implemented in the case of two types of impurities with\\nunknown concentrations. In other words, two impurities\\ndescribed by known on-site potentials _ϵA_ and _ϵB_ are randomly dispersed with respective concentrations _nA_ and\\n_nB_, which are unknown. Writing the CA conductance\\nas a function of both concentrations leads to the misfit function being plotted now as a function of the same\\nquantities in Fig. 3(b). The dashed lines stand for the\\nactual values _nA_ and _nB_ . They accurately match the\\nconcentration values that minimize the misfit function.\\nThis indicates that it is possible to increase the number\\nof degrees of freedom in the inversion procedure, offering\\nvariety and versatility in how we wish to interrogate the\\n\\n\\n\\n(6)\\nThe vertical (black) dotted line shown on the upper part\\nof Fig. 2(b) indicates the value of _n_ _[∗]_ . Note that both\\nthe dotted and dashed lines are aligned, _i.e._, _n_ _[∗]_ coincides not only with the actual concentration _n_ but also\\nwith the impurity concentration that minimizes _χ_ ( _n_ ). In\\nfact, _n_ _[∗]_ is an excellent approximation up to 3% impurity\\nconcentration and provides a simple yet accurate way of\\nidentifying the misfit function minimum. [22]\\nBesides the impurity concentration, other degrees of\\nfreedom can be added to the IP in question.

The (blue) dashed line\\nrepresents the CA conductance ( _M_ = 2000) calculated for the\\nconcentration that minimizes the misfit function _χ_, shown in\\n(b) as a function of _n_ .

Dashed\\n_E−_ _E_\\nline indicates the exact concentration used to generate the\\ninput conductance.\\n\\n\\nsystem. While such an increase may lead to the appearance of more minima in the misfit function, it remains a\\nstraightforward numerical task to identify them all.\\n\\nTo show that this method is indeed model-independent\\nwe have also tested it in the case of a system fully described by Density Functional Theory (DFT). In particular, DFT-based conductance calculations were performed\\nfor armchair GNR of sizes _L_ = 100 unit cells and _W_ = 3 _a_\\ncontaining a specific spatial distribution of _N_ = 10 nitrogen atoms as substitutional impurities, which corresponds to _n_ = 0 _._ 7%. See SM [21] for details of the DFT\\ncalculations. The solid line in Fig. 4(a) shows the conductance spectrum Γ( _E_ ) of the system obtained within\\nDFT, which will now serve as the input conductance for\\nthe inversion procedure. Regarding the CA conductance,\\nthere are two options on how _⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ can be obtained.\\nFirst option is to repeat the steps taken to generate Γ( _E_ )\\nof Fig. 4(a) over several different disorder configurations.\\nBearing in mind that the impurity concentration _n_ must\\nbe kept as a variable parameter, the averaging procedure\\ndefined in Eq. (2) requires _M_ different configurations for\\nevery single value of _n_, which indicates how computationally demanding this task might become if carried out\\nentirely within DFT. The alternative option is to use the\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\ntight-binding (TB) model to carry out the CA calculation. In this case the TB model provides a fast averaging\\nstrategy without necessarily compromising in accuracy.\\nHere, we have selected the latter option and made\\nuse of DFT conductance spectra to identify suitable TB\\nparameters that describe the nitrogen impurities in the\\nGNR. See SM [21] for details, including a brief discussion on the choices available to extract TB parameters\\nfrom DFT calculations [23–26] and their implementation\\nin large scale transport calculations [27–29]. The CA\\nconductance _⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ is then generated within the TB\\nmodel employing _M_ = 2000 realizations, leading subsequently to the misfit function _χ_ ( _n_ ) of Fig. 4(b). Once\\nagain, _χ_ ( _n_ ) displays a minimum at exactly the same nitrogen concentration used to generated the input conductance Γ( _E_ ). Another indication of success can be seen by\\nplotting the CA conductance evaluated at the minimizing concentration of _χ_ ( _n_ ). Shown as a dashed line in\\nFig. 4(a), it has all the key features of Γ( _E_ ) even though\\nboth curves were calculated independently. Despite the\\ncomputational complexity of obtaining the misfit function entirely within DFT, this has also been tested and,\\nreassuringly, we find exactly the same answer (see SM\\n\\n[21] for details).\\nAll input spectra in this manuscript were calculated\\nfrom known Hamiltonians because it is then straightforward to test the success of the inversion method. Ultimately, inversions must be performed based on experimental conductance data of systems for which we do not\\nhave the full Hamiltonian. This calls for an inversion\\ntool that is reliable, general and robust. The fact that\\nour inversion strategy works for systems whose electronic\\nstructures are described by a simple TB model as well as\\nby DFT calculations is indicative of the generality and\\nrobustness of this approach.\\nThat disorder is beneficial to this inversion procedure\\nis made evident by the distinction between the two panels of Fig. 2. Viewed at a fixed energy, the deviation\\nbetween the input and the CA conductance spectra reveals very little about the system. In contrast, the misfit\\nfunction entails a lot of information. The efficiency of the\\nprocedure relies on an ergodic hypothesis: conductance\\nfluctuations of a single sample versus energy are related\\nto sample to sample fluctuations at a fixed energy. More\\nprecisely, the ergodic hypothesis assumes that a running\\naverage over a continuous parameter upon which the conductance depends is equivalent to sampling different impurity configurations. Here the continuous parameter is\\nthe energy, but the concept can be extended to a range of\\nother quantities, _e.g._, magnetic field, gate voltage, etc. A\\nthorough mathematical discussion of this issue is beyond\\nthe scope of this manuscript, but it is worth mentioning\\nthat the ergodic hypothesis can be proven exactly for certain models of disordered systems[30–32]. That explains\\nwhy the energy integration induces a distinctive minimum in _χ_ ( _n_ ) since it is analogous to considering a wider\\n\\n\\nuniverse of disorder configurations in the CA procedure.\\nThe success of the inversion procedure will therefore depend on how wide the integration range is. See SM [21]\\nfor details on the suitable choices for integration limits.\\n\\n\\nAnother feature of the conductance fluctuations of\\nquantum devices [7, 33] is that the correlation function\\n_C_ ( _δX_ ) = _⟨_ Γ( _X_ + _δX/_ 2)Γ( _X_ _−_ _δX/_ 2) _⟩−⟨_ Γ( _X_ ) _⟩_ [2] is also\\nuniversal [31]. The latter is characterized by a correlation length _δX_ cor that is system dependent. Therefore,\\nthe method works best when the integration interval ∆ _X_\\nis such that ∆ _X/δX_ cor 1. In our case, where we con_≫_\\nsider variations of the system chemical potential, _δE_ cor\\nscales with the mean level density times the transmission\\n\\n[34], which makes _δE_ cor much larger than typical experimental temperatures, justifying our earlier claim that\\ntemperature has little effect on our inversion procedure.\\nThis also explains why the energy window used in the\\nmisfit-function definition does not have to be very large.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the inversion procedure presented here\\nprovides a mechanism capable of identifying the composition of scattering centres in a quantum device by simply looking at the energy dependence of the two-terminal\\ndevice conductance. Assuming that the impurity type\\nwithin the device is known, the procedure establishes the\\nexact impurity concentration in it. Alternatively, if no information is known _a_ _priori_ about the scatterers, the inversion identifies their scattering strength and respective\\nconcentration. Finally, with a mixture of two different\\ntypes of impurities we are able to establish the fractional\\nconcentration of each component of the device. Despite\\nbeing presented with GNR, the technique is not materialspecific and performs remarkably well in the ballistic, diffusive and at the onset of localised transport regimes.\\nThe method is based on the notion that conductance\\nfluctuations carry little system-specific information, the\\naverage conductance depends smoothly on the variables\\nof interest and on a standard ergodic hypothesis [30], requiring only an effective (single-particle) description of\\nthe system. [35] This small set of conditions renders a\\nvery robust and versatile methodology that can extract\\nstructural and compositional information of quantum devices from standard transport measurements.\\n\\n\\nThe authors acknowledge support from FAPESP(Grant # FAPESP 2017/02317-2, 2016/01343-7, and\\n2017/10292-0), CNPq (Grants 308801/2015-6 and\\n312716/2018-4), FAPERJ (Grant E-26/202.882/2018),\\nand the ICTP-Simons Foundation Associate Scheme.\\nThe authors also thank the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC/MCTI, Brazil) for providing\\nHPC resources of the SDumont supercomputer, which\\nhave contributed to the results reported here.

For that\\npurpose we use the model system introduced in the main\\ntext as an illustrative example. Our strategy relies on\\ncalculating the conductance spectra that is used as input functions of the inversion method simply because\\nwe can refer back to the Hamiltonian that generated\\nthem in the first place, allowing us to establish whether\\nor not the inversion was successful. A simple test is\\nto start from the Hamiltonian of an arbitrary specific\\nconfiguration of _N_ impurities randomly located and calculate the corresponding conductance spectrum. This\\ntranslates into an impurity concentration _n_ (see main\\nmanuscript). The inversion works by finding the concentration that minimizes the misfit function, which we call\\n_nmin_ . We then define the inversion procedure accuracy\\nas _α_ = _n_ _nmin_ _/n_ . In what follows we analyse how _α_\\n_|_ _−_ _|_\\ndepends on a few essential parameters and show that a\\ncareful tuning of such parameters may improve the success rate of the inversion methodology.\\n\\n\\n**1.** **Accuracy** **of** **the** **inversion** **procedure**\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the inversion accuracy _α_ for graphene\\nnanoribbons (GNR) with _W_ = 3 _a_ and _L_ = 100 unit\\ncells as a function of impurity concentration. One can\\nsee that _α_ is very small for all concentrations below 8%,\\nclearly indicating that our inversion tool is very reliable\\nfor dilute impurity concentrations.\\nIt is worth recalling that we can not only confirm\\nwhat the real impurity concentration that generated the\\nHamiltonian is but also the exact locations of the randomly placed impurities. Interestingly, as the concentration increases we find a growing number of impurities\\nthat are adjacent to one another forming pairs that may\\nact as if they were isolated scatterers. For example, a randomly selected configuration of 15 impurities may have\\n13 of them well isolated whereas the remainder are clustered into a pair. In cases like that the inversion finds a\\nconcentration that would correspond to 14 impurities for\\nthe simple fact that the cluster may actually behave as\\na single scatterer. This explains why the inversion error\\nalso increases with the concentration. It is possible to\\nreduce the error further by accounting for the probability of forming such pairs. By relaxing the assumption\\n\\n\\n\\n0.30\\n\\n\\n0.25\\n\\n\\n0.20\\n\\n\\n0.15\\n\\n\\n0.10\\n\\n\\n0.05\\n\\n\\n0.00\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n#### n (%)\\n\\n\\nFIG. 1.

The impurity on-site potential was arbitrarily\\nchosen as _ϵ_ = 0 _._ 5 _t_ .\\n\\n\\nof short-range uncorrelated disorder originally made, we\\nmay adopt a similar strategy to the one used to produce\\nFigure 3(b) of the main text, _i.e._, where we treat impurity pairs as if they corresponded to a different class\\nof impurities. In this way it is straightforward to discern between isolated and paired impurities, leading to\\nan improved accuracy that can be sustained up to higher\\nconcentrations.\\n\\n\\n**2.** **Averaging** **energy** **window**\\n\\n\\nThe misfit function _χ_ depends on the integration limits\\n_E_ + and _E−_, that is, the averaging energy window.\\nFigure 2 plots the inversion error _α_ as a function of\\n( _E_ + _−E−_ ) _/Z_, where _Z_ is the bandwidth. Note that\\n_α_ is large for very narrow energy windows, in perfect\\nagreement with the single-energy featureless results of\\nFig. 2(a) presented in the main manuscript. Note that\\nany window at least 20% of the bandwidth generates excellent results.\\nIn practical situations, it can be a difficult task to obtain the conductance spectrum over a significant portion\\nof the bandwidth. We argue that good accuracy, _i.e._,\\nsmall values of _α_, can be obtained with fairly small averaging windows. The idea of averaging is to eliminate\\nthe universal conductance fluctuations from the misfit\\nfunction _χ_ . Hence, the averaging window has to be sufficiently broad to contain a large number of oscillations\\nof Γ( _E_ ).

Fortunately,\\nthe conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic systems are\\ncharacterized by _δE_ cor that are typically much smaller\\nthan the band width _Z_ . Theory [1, 2] shows that _δE_ cor\\ndepends essentially on the mean level density and on the\\naverage transmission _⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ . We point out that the\\nsame idea can be extended to variations other than the\\nenergy, such as with external fields, strain, etc.\\n\\n\\n**3.** **Device** **size** **and** **transport** **regime**\\n\\n\\nIt is important to assess how accurate the inversion\\nprocedure is in different transport regimes. Fig. 3 plots\\nthe inversion accuracy as a function of the device size\\n_L_ for a concentration of _n_ = 4%. It is unquestionable\\nthat the accuracy is very good ( _α_ _<_ 0 _._ 1) for all sizes\\nconsidered. It is instructive to put this result in context\\nby looking at the localization length of the system, which\\nin the case of _n_ = 4% of impurities is approximately\\n100 unit cells. That means that the inversion performs\\nremarkably well regardless of the transport regime, i.e.,\\nwhether it is ballistic, diffusive or at the onset of the\\nlocalized regime.\\n\\n\\n**4.** **Averaging** **procedure** **and** **statistical** **significance** **of**\\n**the** **Configuration** **Average** **(CA)** **calculations**\\n\\n\\nAs discussed in the main text, the underlying hypothesis for the applicability of the method are that conductance fluctuations contain very little system-specific information (depending on disorder they can even have a\\nuniversal character) and that the average conductance\\ndepends smoothly on the variables of interest.

In our\\nstudy we employ the ergodic hypothesis to replace averages over configurational disorder (ensemble averages)\\nwith running averages, _i.e._,\\n\\n\\nΓ( _X_ ) = _⟨_ Γ( _X_ ) _⟩_\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\nΓ( _X_ )Γ( _X_ + _δX_ ) = _⟨_ Γ( _X_ )Γ( _X_ + _δX_ ) _⟩_\\n\\nNote that the conductance is a two-point Green’s function. This allows us to justify our statistical assumptions\\nbased on the vast literature on both the Kubo conductity for disordered diffusive bulk systems and Landauer\\nconductance for disordered/chaotic nanostructures.\\nRegarding the number of configurations needed in the\\nCA procedure, as standard, the higher the value of\\ndisorder realizations _M_ the smaller the fluctuations in\\n_⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ . Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF)\\nhelp one to obtain accurate results for _⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ at a\\nmodest value of _M_ . Both for diffusive [4, 5] and chaotic\\nballistic systems [6], var(Γ) _≈_ 1 is the main fingerprint of\\nUCF. Hence, the CA relative statistical error is expected\\nto scale with [ _√M_ _× ⟨_ Γ( _E, n_ ) _⟩_ ] _[−]_ [1] .\\n\\nTo bring the degree of fluctuations to an acceptable\\nlevel and produce results that are statistically significant,\\nwe note that _M_ is usually of the order 10 [3] .

Both _A_ and\\n_B_ result from integrations whose integrands involve the\\nfunction _β_ ( _E_ ) defined in the main text as the _n_ -derivative\\nof the CA conductance evaluated at _n_ = 0. While this\\nis an excellent approximation for _n_ _≤_ 3%, it can be extended to higher concentrations (up to 7%) if we adopt\\nthe following recursive procedure. We must redefine _β_ ( _E_ )\\nas the _n_ -derivative of the CA conductance evaluated at\\nan arbitrary concentration _n_ and follow the steps below:\\n\\n\\n1. Evaluate average _β_ ( _E_ ) between _n_ = 0 and an initial\\nchoice of _n_ .\\n\\n\\n2. Calculate _n_ _[∗]_ using the expression given in the main\\nmanuscript with the average _β_ ( _E_ ) function evaluated in step 1.\\n\\n\\n3. Make _n_ = _n_ _[∗]_ and return to step 1 until _n_ _[∗]_ converges.\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n**II.** **DFT** **CALCULATIONS**\\n\\n\\nThe DFT calculation was performed using a localized\\natomic orbital basis set (LCAO), implemented in the\\nSIESTA package [9]. All calculations were carried out\\nusing a double- _ζ_ basis with polarization orbitals within\\nthe generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [10]\\nfor the exchange and correlation potential. A real space\\nmesh cut-off of 300Ry, and a Monkhorst-Pack k-grid 80\\npoints along the ribbon direction were chosen. The structures were fully relaxed down to a threshold force criteria\\nof 0 _._ 01 _eV/_ Å.\\nCalculations for the disordered system were implemented in the following way: two initial DFT calculations\\nwere done, namely for a pristine GNR, and for a nanoribbon of length _L_ = 7 unit cells containing only a single\\nnitrogen substitutional impurity. From the Hamiltonians\\nof the pristine ribbon and the one containing a single nitrogen, we assemble the N-impurity device by randomly\\ndistributing these building blocks over a fixed length and\\ndefect concentration. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 showing how the building blocks are patched together to form\\nthe device containing a finite concentration of impurities.\\nGiven the localized nature of the basis orbitals, the full\\nHamiltonian for the disordered problem is block tridiagonal. We can thus use a recursive method [11–14] to find\\nthe Green function matrix elements required to compute\\nthe Landauer conductance. These were the steps followed\\nto obtain the conductance spectra Γ( _E_ ) of all DFT-based\\ncalculations.\\n\\n\\n**1.** **DFT-based** **tight-binding** **Hamiltonian**\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous ways of extracting effective tightbinding (TB) Hamiltonians from DFT calculations, all of\\nwhich reproduce the corresponding band structures very\\naccurately [15–17]. Combined with the help of quantum\\ntransport scripts [18], the TB parameters can be exported\\nto highly efficient codes [19–21] that can handle quantum\\ntransport calculations of very large systems. Despite the\\nwide availability of such DFT-based TB Hamiltonians,\\nfor simplicity, the illustrative examples in the manuscript\\nfocus on single-band TB models. We stress, however, the\\nfollowing description is applicable to whichever TB-based\\nmodel one chooses to adopt.\\nInstead of the usual band-structure fitting [22, 23], our\\nadopted procedure consisted of comparing the conductance spectra calculated within DFT and tight-binding.\\nFor the sake of differentiation we refer to them as Γ [DFT] _N_\\nand Γ [TB] _N_ [,] [where] [the] [subscript] [simply] [indicates] [the] [num-]\\nber of impurities contained in the device. From the\\nimpurity-free results, _i.e._ Γ [DFT] 0 and Γ [TB] 0 [,] [it] [is] [straight-]\\nforward to extract the hopping parameter _t_ that best\\ncaptures the electronic structure of the pristine ribbon\\nin question.

Illustrative diagram showing two different building blocks patched together at a random order to generate the\\nfinite-concentration device. The Hamiltonian of both blocks were obtained from DFT calculations.\\n\\n\\n\\nily found from Γ [DFT] 1, which corresponds to the conductance in the presence of only a single impurity. It\\nfollows from a simple plot of the misfit function as a\\nfunction� of the impurity on-site potential, _i.e._ _χ_ ( _ϵ_ ) =\\n_dE_ [Γ [DFT] 1 _−_ Γ [TB] 1 [(] _[ϵ]_ [)]][2][.] [In] [this] [case] [Γ][TB] 1 [(] _[ϵ]_ [)] [is] [the] [tight-]\\nbinding conductance of a ribbon with a single impurity\\nwith on-site potential _ϵ_ . The function _χ_ ( _ϵ_ ) presents a\\nvery distinctive minimum, which we adopt as the value\\nthat best represents the scattering strength of the impurity. It is worth mentioning that it is not necessary\\nto know the exact location of the impurity in the DFT\\ncalculation. In fact, this is automatically accounted for\\nby evaluating the misfit function _χ_ ( _ϵ_ ) for distinct impurity locations in the tight-binding part of the calculation.\\nThis is depicted in Fig.6. The absolute minimum found\\nfor _χ_ ( _ϵ_ ) corresponds to the impurity location used in the\\nDFT-based conductance which also defines the value of\\nthe on-site potential to be adopted in the subsequent CA\\ncalculation.\\nFinally, it is also instructive to compare the conductance spectra Γ [DFT] 1 and Γ [TB] 1 [,] [the] [latter] [being] [calculated]\\nwith the on-site potential _ϵ_ obtained as described above.\\nBearing in mind that the misfit function was obtained\\nby an integration in the 0 _−_ 0 _._ 2 eV energy range, the\\nagreement between the two results shown in Fig.7 is yet\\nanother indication of the effectiveness of our inversion\\nprocedure since both curves were calculated separately\\nand independently.\\n\\n\\n**2.** **DFT-based** **misfit** **function**\\n\\n\\nAlthough the approach described above is undoubtedly a good strategy to illustrate what can be achieved\\nby carrying out the CA calculation within the TB model,\\nit is by no means essential. To make this point evident,\\nwe have also carried out the CA part of the calculation\\nentirely within DFT without availing of any TB parameterization. For each concentration value, M=50 different\\nDFT disordered configurations were considered, each one\\nof them generating conductance spectra with 500 energy\\nvalues.
